A hunched, hollowed creature with its ribcage pushing through thin fungal membrane, dripping black ink with every twitch.
Its limbs bend the wrong way, joints swollen with pulsing fungus that glows faintly thorough the skin
The head is partially collapsed, as if melted inward, with one cavernous hole where spores puff out periodically
Thick cords of fungal mycelium wrap around its torso like ribs on the outside, tightening with every breath
Its body is stretched thin and translucent, organs visible inside as dark shapes suspended in ink
Patches of flesh have fallen away entirely, replaced by layered plates of dark fungal chitin
A bouquet of thin, hair-like fungal tendrils sprouts from its back, writhing like dying snakes
Massive, swollen cavities pockmark its body, some dripping ink, others hosting clusters of spores
Its eyes have fused shut; fungal growths now form rough ridges where the face should be
Morphed faces scream, groan, and writhe upon its fleshy mass, asking for help
It looks gaunt, bones protruding from its actively decaying, spore-ridden body
Multiple eyes litter its entirety. All of them seem to be staring at you
