Deep, irregular footprints filled with slow-moving dark fluid
Claw marks carved into the soil, the grooves still wet with residue
A long drag mark as if something heavy was pulled or crawled across the ground
Large, distorted footprints with fungal threads growing outward from the edges
A single, deep gouge in the ground as though a tail or limb scraped along
Footprints that are both human-like and not, alternating between bipedal and quadrupedal spacing
A single pawprint deeper than the rest, indicating a sudden shift in weight or aggression
Footprints arranged in a strange ritual-like circle before continuing onward
Blood from an unknown sapient follows an eerie trail towards a nearby cave
